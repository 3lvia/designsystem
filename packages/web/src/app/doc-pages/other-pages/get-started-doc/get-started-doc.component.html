      The design system helps designers and developers create software with a consistent look and feel and
      saves time by allowing us to reuse components and design elements across multiple systems and sketches.

      <div class="e-mt-24">
        We separate the available components into a style library and separate components. The style library
        is called elvis and can be used to get styling with html classes. For more advanced components we
        offer separate packages that can be used individually. When browsing our components it will be clear
        what kind of component it is by looking at the code examples or the installation guidelines. Find all
        the components under "Components" in the main menu.

                or active. There’s a bit more tips to help you with color usage in our

              The typography we use is available in two optical sizes: Red Hat Text and Red Hat Display. The
              Display version is most often used in bigger texts, such as titles, while the Text version is
              used in standard text blocks, to provide better readability. The font family is open-source and

              Through the 8 point grid we can ensure higher consistency through using multiples of 8 to space

              components and full pages are scalable for a wide variety of devices.

                <strong>Submenu</strong>
                - Submenues are the main menu-items (about, brand, components, patterns, tools). If you are
                adding new documentation pages you must also add the page to the submenu entry for that menu
                in Contentful. If you are adding a new brand page, remember to also add a new 'Overview card'
                to the landing page for that submenu.

              <li>
                <strong>Documentation page</strong>
                - The documentation pages should serve as the base for all content on a page. These pages can
                be previewed with all content, even if that content also is just in draft. The page needs a
                title, path and content and should usually also have a description. When adding a new
                documentation page you also have to add it to the correct submenu.

              <li>
                <strong>Image</strong>
                - Images should be added through the image entry model and the image require a name, alt-text
                and an asset / media. If you want the image to be placed next to text you should put that text
                in the "Content next to image" and then chose the correct alignment in the "Alignment" field.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Links</strong>
                - All links should be created through the link entry model. Links have to have a link-text and
                either an url to an existing page on design.eliva.io or an url to an external page. When
                linking to pages on design.elvia.io always use the "Url design.elvia.io (internal)" field.

              <li>
                <strong>Centered content</strong>

                grid.

              When testing your content you have the "preview" option available in the right sidebar. This
              will open a link in a new tab showing how the content will look after you publish it. It will
              also display error-messages if your content is incorrect. It is therefore important to always
              check the preview before publishing to make sure the content is correct. The preview button is
              only clickable on documentation pages, but all content on that page will be visible in the
              preview, even if it's not published yet.
              <div class="e-mt-24">
                <img

              <h3 class="e-title-xs">Publish</h3>
              Publish only once all the content is fully ready. Most of the time you should be working with
              your content in draft without publishing it and use the preview until you are happy with the
              page and are ready to publish. You can easily send preview-links to other people for them to
              review your changes before publishing, to ensure that everything is correct. You will not be
              able to publish your content if you have errors, but you should always check the documentation
              page preview before publishing anyways.

                Publishing anything will also trigger a new build and deploy of the design system website.
                This means that you should only publish once something is completely finished so that the
                build does not have to be triggered all the time.

              <div class="e-mt-24">
                You can also publish multiple things at the same time by e.g. sorting on a content type on the
                "content" tab page and then marking all the checkboxes before pushing the "Publish" or
                "Republish" button.

              Any entry can be deleted as long as you are sure the entry is not used anywhere in Contentful.
              If you are creating an entry by mistake, you should delete it so that there is not a lot of
              unused entries floating around. If you want to be sure that you are not deleting an entry that
              is being used, look at the right sidebar under links.

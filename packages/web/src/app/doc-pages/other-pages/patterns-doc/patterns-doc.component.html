      <p class="e-text-body e-mt-16 e-mb-72">
        A form is a group of input fields and selections for users to enter data. Forms can be simple or
        complex, but always try to make it easy, clear and quickly for the user to use.
      </p>
      <span class="e-title-sm">One column</span>
      <p class="e-text-body e-mt-16 e-mb-72">
        To improve the scanability of a form stack the input fields vertically and display it as a single
        column. This makes it easier and faster for user to scan. Exceptions for this is related fields like
        postcode and city or date of birth.
      </p>
      <span class="e-title-sm">Mark optional</span>
      <p class="e-text-body e-mt-16 e-mb-72">
        Some input fields can be optional or required. In Elvia, we mark the optional fields. Most times there
        are more required fields than optional, so to avoid visual noise and use a more positive tone to it,
        we write “optional” behind the label to indicate who’s optional.
      </p>
      <span class="e-title-sm">Length of the input field</span>
      <p class="e-text-body e-mt-16 e-mb-72">
        The size of the input field should reflect the expected answer. For example, a postcode field should
        therefore be shorter in size than the address field.
      </p>

      </div>
      <span class="e-title-sm">Complex forms</span>
      <p class="e-text-body e-mt-16 e-mb-16">
        Forms can be long and complex and this can put some users off. To make a better experience for the
        user you can group related questions and break up the form in separate pages or steps. Use a stepper
        to inform the user how long the form is and where they are in the process.
      </p>
      <p class="e-text-body e-mt-16 e-mb-72">
        Keep it simple, so try to remove all non-essential fields. Ask the user for truly necessary
        information and remove the rest.
      </p>
      <span class="e-title-sm">Enable the buttons</span>
      <p class="e-text-body e-mt-16 e-mb-72">
        You often disable a button untill all the required fields and inputs are filled out. A disabled button
        can make the user irritated, confused, and make the user feel stupid. A better solution is to enable
        the button and rather guide the user to the missing fields with red error indications when they are
        trying to submit the form.

      <p class="e-text-body">
        Empty states are moments when there is no data and nothing to display to the user. In these cases the
        user needs to be informed what’s happenening and what to do about it.
      </p>

        <ul class="e-list">
          <li>Error page, like 404</li>
          <li>Searching for something but no results was found</li>
          <li>Confirmation page when you have completed something, like submitting a form</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <span class="e-title-sm">Inform the user</span>
      <p class="e-text-body e-mt-16 e-mb-72">
        A good empty state should explain what’s going on in plain language. Tell the user what the next step
        is and guide them forward with a button or link if needed.
      </p>
      <span class="e-title-sm">Tone of voice</span>
      <p class="e-text-body e-mt-16 e-mb-72">
        Don’t use product-specific terms that the user may not understand. Use a positive tone and motivate
        the user, maybe by the use of humor or add some emojis in the message.
      </p>
      <span class="e-title-sm">Visuals</span>
      <p class="e-text-body e-mt-16 e-mb-72">
        Use a graphical elements to support the information such as illustrations, colors and icons. You can
        use a neautral or humorous tone to it, but try to play with our concept off/on - most often this is a
        great opportunity for when something is off!

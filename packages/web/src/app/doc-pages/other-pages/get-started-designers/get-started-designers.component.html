        get started right away. That’s why we have gathered a short summary of the most important information

  <!--ELVIA BRAND AND DESIGN CONCEPT-->
  <app-component-section [sectionTitle]="'Elvia brand and design concept'">
    <ng-container ngProjectAs="sectionContent">
      Elvia is characterized by being ON as an energy provider. The most important identity marker is Elvia’s
      logo, which should be used in all visual communication. You can

      </div>

      <p>
        In our design language, we use round forms and circles in combination with our green profile color to
        symbolize environmentally friendly energy and to show that Elvia is ON, activated and fully charged.
        You can read more about the brand on

  <!--COLORS AND STYLE-->

    <ng-container ngProjectAs="sectionContent">
      <div class="flex-img-container">
        <div class="color-text">
          The main colors we use are black, grey, white and green. The green color specifically should only be
          used in details and - in the cases where it works - to symbolize that something is on, or active.
          There’s a bit more tips to help you with color usage in our
          <a class="e-link e-link--inline" [routerLink]="['/brand/color']">color guidelines.</a>

      <p>
        The typography we use is available in two optical sizes: Red Hat Text and Red Hat Display. The Display
        version is most often used in bigger texts, such as titles, while the Text version is used in standard
        text blocks, to provide better readability. The font family is open-source and
        <a
          class="e-link e-link--inline e-link--new-tab"
          href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Display"

          <span class="e-link__icon"><i class="e-icon e-icon--new_tab-bold"></i></span>
        </a>
        via Google Fonts. You can read more about our usage of it on our
        <a class="e-link e-link--inline" [routerLink]="['/brand/typography']">typography page.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        For our icon library, we use Streamline as a base. We do however do find ourselves in cases where we
        need to tailor icons to fit our specific needs, and adjust when we need to. To see the full overview
        of available icons in Elvia’s design system, see our
        <a class="e-link e-link--inline" [routerLink]="['/brand/icon']">icons page.</a>
        We continuously add new ones depending on demand, so if you can’t find what you need for your project,
        let us know.

  <!--GRID AND BREAKPOINTS-->
  <app-component-section [sectionTitle]="'Grid and breakpoints'">
    <ng-container ngProjectAs="sectionContent">
      <img class="e-w-100" src="../../../../assets/get-started-designers/GRID.svg" />

      <p>
        In Elvia, we follow the 8 point grid. If you haven’t worked with it before we recommend you to read
        <a
          class="e-link e-link--inline e-link--new-tab"
          href="https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632"
          target="_blank"
        >
          <span class="e-link__title">an intro to the 8 point grid.</span>
          <span class="e-link__icon"><i class="e-icon e-icon--new_tab-bold"></i></span>
        </a>
        Through the 8 point grid we can ensure higher consistency through using multiples of 8 to space out
        elements. This helps us define dimensions, paddings and margin to make sure that both components and
        full pages are scalable for a wide variety of devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have defined breakpoints for different types of devices that we follow to make sure we create
        responsive interfaces. You can read more about this in
        <a class="e-link e-link--inline" [routerLink]="['/brand/grid']" fragment="Breakpoints">
          the breakpoints section.

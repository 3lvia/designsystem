        Everything we say should be clear, useful and easy to understand for the customer, regardless of
        whether they know who we are or what they can expect from us.
      </p>

      <p>This means that we have to think about the following when we write or talk to the customer:</p>

      <ol class="e-list e-list--numbers e-mt-24">
        <li>
          <strong>We are ON.</strong>
          We understand the everyday life and the challenges of our customers. We fully understand that the
          power industry can be confusing both when it comes to language, concepts, who is responsible for
          what, et cetera. Written dialogue should be perceived as a conversation, not as generic information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We are human and real.</strong>
          Although Elvia has the role of "monopolist", the company consists of ordinary people. Therefore, we
          can also relate to our customers, who are also ordinary people. We have understanding and empathy,
          and we talk to them in a friendly and open way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We translate.</strong>
          The language of the power industry is often complex and confusing, and only experts can make the
          difficult easy. That is why we work to make the online industry more understandable and increase our
          customers’ knowledge. We do this through clear and simple, but not stupefying, communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We have a twinkle in our eye.</strong>
          Even though we have monopoly and an important role in society we are by no means mundane. Elvia has
          a fair and subtle kind of humor; we rather give a small wink than shout. We are never condescending
          or exclusive and we include the customer.
        </li>
      </ol>

  <!--TONE-->
  <app-component-section [sectionTitle]="'Tone'">
    <ng-container ngProjectAs="sectionContent">
      <p>
        A tone may vary depending on the situation you’re in. You may use a completely different tone when
        talking to friends than when talking to your boss. The tone can also change depending on the emotional
        state of the person you are talking to.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we talk or write with a customer, it is therefore important that we look at the customer's
        situation - is it a crisis or is it a general question? Is the customer happy or angry? A rule of
        thumb may be that you do not use the same tone to a customer who is scared or sad than for a customer
        who is happy and satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elvia's tone is professional, but never strictly so. We are clear and speak the customer's language.
        Put yourself in the customer's situation when formulating yourself. Why is the customer confused? Is
        the customer impatient because he or she aren’t getting an answer fast enough? Once you have settled
        some thoughts about where the customer is in the emotional register, you can adjust your tone
        accordingly. A rule of thumb is to meet the customer where they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, we say that our tone can change, but our voice is the same. Elvia’s tone is professional,
        but friendly and instructive. You can read more about Elvia’s style and tone on

      When we adhere to certain rules of grammar and mechanics in our language, it helps us to create content
      that is clear and consistent - regardless of who produces the content. This section contains clear
      examples that help us maintain our style and tone, that applies across all content.

      <div class="e-accordion e-accordion--group e-mt-72">

              <h4 class="e-title-xs e-mt-24 e-mb-8">Active language</h4>
              An important part of Elvia's brand is to be ON. This should be reflected in an active language,
              rather than a passive language. An active language and an active voice turn themes in a text
              into an action that is going on (present), and not something that has been done (past).
              <p>
                Words like "was" and "off" are perceived as passive - especially in written form. Therefore,
                you should rather use words that are active and write in the present tense. Exceptions may be
                if you want to highlight a specific action, for example if you need to confirm that something
                has been done.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h4 class="e-title-xs e-mt-24 e-mb-8">Positive language</h4>
              Use a positive language rather than a negative. One way to detect negative language is to look
              for words and phrases such as "can not", "not", etc.
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 class="e-title-xs e-mt-64 e-mb-8">Emoji usage</h4>
              Emojis are a fun and easy way to add humor and mirror the customer's language, but use them
              infrequently, consciously and only on channels where it is natural, such as on social media.
              Emojis can be used when it is natural to reflect the customer's language and tone.
              <p>
                A rule of thumb is to use only a maximum of two emojis in a post or message.

                    Weather conditions can be natural to use in connection with e.g. storm, precipitation and
                    drought that may affect our services

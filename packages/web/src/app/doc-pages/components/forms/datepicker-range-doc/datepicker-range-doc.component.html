  <!-- SIZE -->
  <app-component-section size [sectionTitle]="'Size'">
    There are two different sizes of the date range picker; medium and small. Just like small text fields, the
    small date range picker is primarily designed for internal systems. Don't mix medium and small size inputs
    in one layout–choose one or the other and be consistent in your choice throughout the design.

  <!-- OPTIONS -->
  <app-component-section size [sectionTitle]="'Options'">
    There are two different sizes of the date range picker; medium and small. Just like small text fields, the

    <app-component-subsection [sectionTitle]="'Shortcuts'">
      We suggest combining Datepicker Range with
      <a class="e-link e-link--inline" [routerLink]="['/components/radio-filter']">Radio Filter</a>
      to create shortcuts that reduce the number of clicks. The options should be periods of time most often
      used depending on the use case.

      <app-datepicker-range-shortcut-example class="e-mt-56" />
    </app-component-subsection>

    <app-component-subsection [sectionTitle]="'Fewer clicks'">
      Use
      <code>hasAutoOpenEndDatepicker</code>
      if users typically need to select values for all inputs to do their task. It reduces the number of
      clicks by automatically opening the next picker overlay after selecting from date.
    </app-component-subsection>

    <app-component-subsection [sectionTitle]="'Current time as default'">
      Use
      <code>hasSelectDateOnOpen</code>
      to automatically selects the current date and time when opening the picker overlay. It helps users find
      the correct date and time by starting from now.
    </app-component-subsection>

    <app-component-subsection [sectionTitle]="'Responsive stacking'">
      When the screen size becomes smaller than 767px, the date pickers will stack vertically. When needed,
      use
      <code>isVertical</code>
      to always keep this stacking order.

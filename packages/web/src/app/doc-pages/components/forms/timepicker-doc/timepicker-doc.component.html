  <!-- SIZE -->
  <app-component-section size [sectionTitle]="'Size'">
    There are two different sizes of the time picker; medium and small. Much like small text fields, the small
    time picker picker is a version of the text field that’s primarily designed for internal systems, and
    shouldn’t be mixed with the other input style.

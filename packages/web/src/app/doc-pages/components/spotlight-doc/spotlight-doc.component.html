  <!--USAGE-->
  <app-component-section usage [sectionTitle]="'Usage'">
    <app-component-subsection [sectionTitle]="'Size of spotlight'">
      The spotlight should have a padding of approximately 24px from the element. To get the correct circle
      radius, find the largest measurement (width or height) of the object you want to light up, divide by 2,
      and add 24px to the find the correct radius.
    </app-component-subsection>
  </app-component-section>

  <!--IMPLEMENTATION-->
  <app-component-section implementation [sectionTitle]="'Implementation'">
    <app-component-subsection [sectionTitle]="'Circle'">
      For the circle shape, the position of the spotlight is determined by the center of the circle.
      <app-component-subsubsection [sectionTitle]="'Position'">
        To find the center of the element which is where the circle will start from, you can use these
        formulas:
        <div class="code-text e-mt-40">horizontal = rect.left + rect.width / 2</div>
        <div class="code-text e-mt-16">vertical = rect.top + rect.height / 2</div>
      </app-component-subsubsection>
      <app-component-subsubsection [sectionTitle]="'Radius'">
        To find the correct radius you need to find the largest measurement, either height or width of the
        element. This formula can be helpful to find the correct radius:
        <div class="code-text e-mt-40">radius = ((Math.max(width, height)/2) + 24px)</div>
      </app-component-subsubsection>
    </app-component-subsection>
    <app-component-subsection [sectionTitle]="'Rectangle'">
      <app-component-subsubsection [sectionTitle]="'Position'">
        For the rectangle shape, the position prop will correspond to the top left corner of the spotlight.
        This corresponds with the
        <span class="code-text">top</span>
        and
        <span class="code-text">left</span>
        values from the
        <span class="code-text">getBoundingClientRect()</span>
        method on the element you wish to spotlight.
      </app-component-subsubsection>
      <app-component-subsubsection [sectionTitle]="'Width and Height'">
        The width and height of the rectangle will be the same as the width and height of the element you wish
        to spotlight. Remember that to add the 24px padding to the spotlight, you will need to add padding to
        the width and height of the rectangle, and offset the position by half of the padding.
      </app-component-subsubsection>
    </app-component-subsection>
    <div class="e-mt-40">
      Remember to also listen to the scroll-position and update position of the element if it is possible to
      scroll on your page.
    </div>
  </app-component-section>

          <strong>Role:</strong>
          If you are placing an element on top of the spotlight, remember to add
          <span class="code-text">role="dialog"</span>
          to that element to separate it from the rest of the application.

  <!--IMPLEMENTATION-->
  <app-component-section implementation [sectionTitle]="'Implementation'">
    The badge component acts as a wrapper. You should only use badges on Icon Button or Thumbnails. Note how
    the badge places itself relative to its content, meaning you can place a badge component within other
    elements, such as the icon in an Icon Button element. Use slots to give the badge its content.

  <!--USAGE-->
  <app-component-section usage [sectionTitle]="'Usage'">
    <app-component-subsection [sectionTitle]="'Color'">
      The
      <code>neutral</code>
      badge color adapts to user's color scheme, turning black in light mode and white in dark mode.
    </app-component-subsection>
  </app-component-section>

  <!--ACCESSIBILITY-->
  <app-component-section accessibility [sectionTitle]="'Accessibility'">
    You can't rely on the badge's content being announced correctly. You should include a detailed
    description, such as
    <span class="code-text">aria-label</span>
    .

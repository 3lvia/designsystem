      It is not only outdoors that you should watch for dangerous conditions, there are also things in the
      home that you should be aware of. For example, if you experience a shock when you turn on the water tap
      or other electrical appliances, it is a bad sign. The same applies if the fuse blows without you knowing
      why, or if the fuse blows every time you use two appliances at the same time. This should not happen and
      may be a sign that there is a danger on the way in the electrical system.

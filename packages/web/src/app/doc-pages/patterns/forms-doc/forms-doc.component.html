      <p>
        Long, complex forms can can put some users off. Improve the experience by grouping related inputs and
        breaking the form into steps. Use a
        <a class="e-link e-link--inline" routerLink="/components/stepper">stepper</a> to show progress. Keep
        it simple—remove non-essential fields and ask only for necessary information.
      </p>
    </app-component-subsection>
    <app-component-subsection sectionTitle="Mark optional">
      <p>
        Some input fields are optional, others required. At Elvia, we mark optional fields by adding
        “optional” after the label. Since most fields are required, this reduces visual noise and keeps a
        positive tone. Learn more in our
        <a class="e-link e-link--inline" routerLink="/patterns/validations">validation patterns</a> guide.

    <app-component-subsection sectionTitle="Layout and length of the column">
      <p>
        For better scanability, inputs are stacked vertically in a single column. Closely related fields
        (e.g., start and end date) can be grouped. Columns should be full or half-width, matching the expected
        input. When combining fields like postal code and city, the first input sets the size, and the second
        fills the remaining space.

  <app-component-section sectionTitle="Enable the buttons">
    <p>
      In some interfaces, buttons are disabled until all required inputs are filled out. Disabled buttons can
      make the user irritated, confused, and make the user feel stupid. A better solution is to enable the
      button and rather guide the user to the missing fields with red error indications when they are trying
      to submit the form.

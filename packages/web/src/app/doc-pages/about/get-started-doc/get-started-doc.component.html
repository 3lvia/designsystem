      Our design system, Elvis, provides components and utilities in a CSS library and as separate web
      components. The CSS library
      <code>&#64;elvia/elvis</code>
      consists of the most basic components like links, tags and inputs as well as utilities like colors,
      typography and icons. All assets in the CSS library are prefixed with <code>e-</code>.

    As a designer, there’s a few resources to gather before getting started with the design system in Elvia.
    First thing to do is to make sure you have access to the Figma library.

    <div class="e-flex e-flex-direction-column e-gap-16 e-mt-40 e-px-16">
      <!--Figma-->

              for the full experience. If you have any issues accessing the

              , just ask someone in the team and we’ll send you an invite. We can of course also help you set
              up libraries in Figma if you’re new to it.

            Through the 8 point grid we can ensure higher consistency through using multiples of 8 to space
            out elements. This helps us define dimensions, paddings and margin to make sure that both

            The contentful structure is made up of different content types. In the content tab you can find
            all the content that is relevant for you to edit. Every page on design.elvia.io is called a
            'documentation page' in Contentful. These documentation pages are the bases for adding or editing
            content.

              You can also add / embed entries at the top right of the field. Entries are models we have made
              to make it possible to customize the content more. When adding an image or link you should
              always add them by using these models. If you want the entry to be inline with the text you
              should choose "inline entry." Inline images are added in a different way that can be read about

                When you are adding entries you can choose to either use an existing entry and search through

                done by clicking the "Create new entry" button in the top right corner of the "Add entry"

          These are some of the models and options you can use to edit content in Contentful. If you want to

          are on the "content" tab.
          <ul class="e-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Submenu</strong>
              - Submenues are the main menu-items (about, brand, components, patterns, tools). If you are
              adding new documentation pages you must also add the page to the submenu entry for that menu in
              Contentful. If you are adding a new brand page, remember to also add a new 'Overview card' to
              the landing page for that submenu.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Documentation page</strong>
              - The documentation pages should serve as the base for all content on a page. These pages can be
              previewed with all content, even if that content also is just in draft. The page needs a title,
              path and content and should usually also have a description. When adding a new documentation
              page you also have to add it to the correct submenu.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Image</strong>
              - Images should be added through the image entry model and the image require a name, alt-text
              and an asset / media. If you want the image to be placed next to text you should put that text
              in the "Content next to image" and then chose the correct alignment in the "Alignment" field.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Links</strong>
              - All links should be created through the link entry model. Links have to have a link-text and
              either an url to an existing page on design.eliva.io or an url to an external page. When linking
              to pages on design.elvia.io always use the "Url design.elvia.io (internal)" field.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Centered content</strong>
              - You can center any content by using the centered content model in Contentful and then add the
              content that should be centered there.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>List</strong>
              - Make lists through the Contentful option-bar at the top of the content field.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Icon list</strong>
              - To make a icons list can be made by starting each bullet point with an inline image. The image
              should an icon and the size is 32px X 32px.

            <li>
              <strong>Download content</strong>
              - If you want to offer downloadable files or images on design.elvia.io, e.g. illustrations or
              logos, you can use this model. For images use SVG format preferably. Each download content entry
              you make will get its own button for downloading.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Grid</strong>
              - The grid model can be used to place download content or images in a grid view (multiple next
              to each other). Make sure to choose either download content or image and not both in the same
              grid.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>When & When not to use</strong>
              - The model generates lists of points on when to use and when not to use a something, mostly
              used for component.

            <h3 class="e-title-xs">Previews</h3>
            When testing your content you have the "preview" option available in the right sidebar. This will
            open a link in a new tab showing how the content will look after you publish it. It will also
            display error-messages if your content is incorrect. It is therefore important to always check the
            preview before publishing to make sure the content is correct. The preview button is only
            clickable on documentation pages, but all content on that page will be visible in the preview,
            even if it's not published yet.

            <h3 class="e-title-xs">Publish</h3>
            Publish only once all the content is fully ready. Most of the time you should be working with your
            content in draft without publishing it and use the preview until you are happy with the page and
            are ready to publish. You can easily send preview-links to other people for them to review your
            changes before publishing, to ensure that everything is correct. You will not be able to publish
            your content if you have errors, but you should always check the documentation page preview before
            publishing anyways.

              Publishing anything will also trigger a new build and deploy of the design system website. This
              means that you should only publish once something is completely finished so that the build does
              not have to be triggered all the time.
            </div>
            <div class="e-mt-24">
              You can also publish multiple things at the same time by e.g. sorting on a content type on the
              "content" tab page and then marking all the checkboxes before pushing the "Publish" or
              "Republish" button.

      <b>Note:</b> This method is originally made for 6 participants, but can of course be done with less. If
      you’re a larger group, try splitting up into multiple smaller groups.
    </p>
    <ol class="e-list e-list--numbers">
      <li>
        Give all participants an A4 sheet of paper and instruct them to divide it into a 3x5 grid (draw two
        vertical and four horizontal lines over the paper)
      </li>
      <li>
        Set a timer for 5 minutes and ask participants to fill out the top three empty boxes with separate
        ideas
      </li>
      <li>
        Pass all papers to the right and set a new timer for 5 minutes. This time participants take
        inspiration from the previous ideas and continue filling out the next row of empty boxes.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat this pattern until all boxes are full. In the end, discuss your favorites together.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Tip!</b> Remember that participants can choose themselves if they want to develop the previous ideas,
      of if they choose to simply add new ones. All ideas are good ideas!

    <figure class="figure--center">
      <img [src]="`assets/doc-pages/tools/ideation/brainstorming_${_theme}.png`" alt="" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> Although brainstorm is a loose term used widely, you can easily elevate your results by
      approaching them with structure and making sure everyone in the group can contribute.
    </p>
    <ol class="e-list e-list--numbers">
      <li>Define a theme for the brainstorm.</li>
      <li>Set a timer and let participants individually write down as many ideas as they can.</li>
      <li>
        When the timer is up, let participants take turns presenting their ideas (and remember to save the
        critical assessment until everyone’s done presenting). After this, analyze your results and narrow
        your ideas by using an
        <a class="e-link e-link--inline" routerLink="/tools/evaluation">evaluation</a> method.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Tip!</b> Use using different approaches to achieve different results. One approach could be to ask
      participants to eliminate all constraints by thinking in the realm of unlimited possibilities, or you
      could actively choose to brainstorm bad ideas only (and later ask how you can flip them).

      <li>
        Give all participants an A4 sheet of paper and instruct them to fold it into 8 sections (divide the
        paper in half, 3 times).
      </li>
      <li>
        Set a timer for 8 minutes and ask participants to fill out the boxes with separate ideas, one minute
        per box.
      </li>
      <li>Ask participants to present their ideas to the group and discuss the results together.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Tip!</b> All ideas are good ideas! Remember to inform the participants of this. Try starting with an
      <a class="e-link e-link--inline" routerLink="/tools/icebreakers">icebreakers</a> before ideating to get
      the group started. Another tips is to play music in the background for the sketching session.

    </figure>
    <ol class="e-list e-list--numbers">
      <li>
        Based on your problem statement, ask questions of “What if...”, for example:
        <ul class="e-list">
          <li>What if you made it for children?</li>
          <li>What if you use gamification mechanics?</li>
          <li>What if the users were blind?</li>
          <li>What if the budget was unlimited?</li>
          <li>What if it was a dating service?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        hink of ways to solve the problem statement using the prompts. Ask participants to generate as many
        ideas per prompt as they can before you move on to the next.
      </li>
      <li>
        When done, let participants take turns presenting their ideas. Decide if you want to keep ideating
        around your favorite ideas, or use an
        <a class="e-link e-link--inline" routerLink="/tools/evaluation">evaluation</a> method to analyze your
        results.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Tip!</b> You can easily tailor the time frame by adjusting number of prompts and ideation time. Try
      gathering inspiration for your prompts from ideation cards (for example
      <a
        class="e-link e-link--inline e-link--new-tab"
        href="https://www.trytriggers.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
      >
        <span class="e-link__title">Trigger Cards</span>
        <span class="e-link__icon">
          <e-icon name="newTabBold" />
        </span>
      </a>
      ), or online sources (try
      <a
        class="e-link e-link--inline e-link--new-tab"
        href="https://whtifs.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
      >
        <span class="e-link__title">whtifs</span>
        <span class="e-link__icon">
          <e-icon name="newTabBold" />
        </span> </a
      >).

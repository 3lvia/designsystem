        Now, everyone is challenged to transform their squiggles into birds. This could be done by adding

        You don’t have to be a good drawer for this exercise, and it’s especially helpful when warming up for
        a sketching workshop. If you want more variation, you can try changing the theme of animals to draw,
        or even decide to draw a squiggle zoo of various animals.

## üìö How to use

Read our [get started guide](https://design.elvia.io/about/get-started) at design.elvia.io to get started
using our CSS library and components. The CSS library and the components can be used through both NPM packages
and CDN.

### CSS library (Elvis)

**CSS library usage example:**

```html
<button class="e-btn">Button</button>
```

### Components

**Component usage example:**

```html
<elvia-progress-linear [value]="20"></elvia-progress-linear>
```

### Using icons

Our icon library is based on Streamline icons. The icons that are from Streamline is not made accessible under
the same license as this npm package. Those icons are still the property of Webablys LLC. Elvia has bought a
license for the use of these icons in the organization. They can also be used in open source projects as long
as you follow their license.

## üíª Development

- [Design system Architecture](https://elvia.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TEAMATOM/pages/64486539701/Designsystem+v2).
  Find more information about the CSS library and Components library in the Confluence folder
  [Development / Architecture](https://elvia.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TEAMATOM/pages/309562041/Utvikling+og+arkitektur).

### Technology

- We use **Yarn**, NPM will probably not work as expected.
- We use a monorepo structure with **Yarn workspaces**.
- We use **Angular** for the main documentation page and **Netlify** to host the site.
- We use **React** to build our components and wrap them as
  **[Custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements)** to
  make them accessible for multiple JavaScript frameworks.
- We use **Jest** for unit testing of our components.
- **[Styled components](https://styled-components.com/)**,
  **[classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)** and **SCSS** for styling our components.
- We use **[Percy](https://percy.io/)** for visual regression testing for our CSS library.
- We use **Figma** for sketching the components. The
  [Elvia figma](https://www.figma.com/files/880078299274452916/project/5995782/%F0%9F%92%9A-Designsystemet?fuid=911220117114249697)
  has all the sketches for our components.
- We use **Contentful** as content management system for a lot of our documentation.
- We use **SonarCloud** for automatic code quality checks.
- We use [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) to run build, tests and linting before committing or
  pushing.

### How we work

Read more about how we work inside the team e.g. with our backlog in Jira, or our component flow (creating new

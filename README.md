## Get Started
Elvis is the design library Elvia use for external and internal systems. Elvis provides classes and variables for styling components, as well as templates, accessibility rules and design principles for all developers and designers at Elvia to follow. This guide provides you how to install the project and how to use the classes and variables provided.

### Installing Elvis

Install the npm package:

``$ npm install @hafslundnett/elvis --save``

Import main.sass in your stylesheet:
``@import '~@hafslundnett/elvis/src/main.scss';``

### Use Components
All components consists of classes that are available through the Elvis style library. Which classes to use is documented for each component. The syntax for classes: ``class = "e-name-of-class"``

### Use CSS-variables
For most of the utilities like colors, shadows and spacing CSS-variables are also provided. All these variables are available when importing the main.scss file in your stylesheet, meaning you don't need to import any specific files to use them.
The syntax for CSS-variables: ``var(--e-name-of-class)``

#### IE Support
[Ponyfill documentation](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/css-vars-ponyfill/#/)

The CSS-variables are not supported by IE11 and a ponyfill is therefore added as a dependency. But this library is offered as a ponyfill, not a polyfill, meaning that the code below needs to be added to your project, in your main.js/ts file, for processing to take place:

```
/* main.js/ts - file */
  
import cssVars from 'css-vars-ponyfill';

cssVars({
  include: 'style',
  onlyLegacy: true,
  watch: true,
});
```
